# Unidad-1-Actividad-2

A continuación se presentan algunas actividades las cuales se deberán subir a la plataforma *github classroom*. Siga las instrucciones y/o conteste lo que se pide.

* Try Support Vector Machine regressor (cklearn.svm.SVR), with various hyperparameters such as kernel="linear" (with various values for the C hyperparameter) or kernel="rbf" (with various values for the C and gamma hyperparameters). Don't worry about what these hyperparameters mean for now. How does the best SVR predictor perform?.
* Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.

* Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the most important attibutes.

* Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus the final prediction.

* Automatically explore some preparation option using GridSearch.

* Using the Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset, and following *the checklist* for ML projects make next:

  * Try linear regression, polynomial regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine to classify malignant or benign cancer.
  * You should use pipelines, grid search, random search and k-fold cross validation to find the best model.
  * Make a table with the comparison of models performances.
  * Make a table with the comparison of algorithms performances (time consuming and computational time).

 Remember to use charts, tables, examples, etc. And all is in jupyter notebook. Like in the examples.
